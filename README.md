# 🔐 AI Security Assurance Labs  
### By: Frederick Baffour

This repository is a **professional-grade AI Security Assurance portfolio**, demonstrating the complete lifecycle of securing, validating, and red-teaming AI models using industry-standard frameworks and tools.

It showcases **hands-on engineering workflows**, **governance-aligned security controls**, and **real-world defensive techniques** used in enterprise AI security programs.

# 🧭 What This Repository Demonstrates

This portfolio covers the **full AI assurance pipeline**:

1. **Model Supply-Chain Security**  
   - Trusted source verification  
   - SHA-256 integrity checks  
   - YARA static analysis  
   - ClamAV malware scanning  
   - SBOM generation & validation  
   - Model provenance & documentation  

2. **Security Toolchain Integrity**  
   - Binary validation using Sigcheck  
   - Verification of scanning tools  
   - Trusted execution environment checks  

3. **LLM Red Teaming & Behavioral Evaluation**  
   - Garak automated vulnerability testing  
   - Promptfoo adversarial evaluations  
   - Jailbreak & prompt injection frameworks  
   - Hallucination, toxicity, and refusal-bypass analysis  

4. **AI Risk, Governance & Model Safety**  
   - Risk classification & criticality tiers  
   - NIST AI RMF mapping  
   - MITRE ATLAS threat alignment  
   - Safety evaluation frameworks  
   - Governance-ready reporting templates  

5. **End-to-End Intake Pipeline**  
   From Stage 1 (intake & malware checks)  
   → Stage 2 (supply-chain vetting)  
   → Stage 3 (red teaming)  
   → Stage 4 (approval & governance)

# 🚀 How to Navigate (Start Here)

### **If you’re a Recruiter or Reviewer (non-technical):**  
Start with:

- `risk-and-governance/model-risk-classification.md`
- `risk-and-governance/model-criticality-tiering.md`
- `docs/governance-edition-ai-assurance-guide.md`

These provide a clear overview of my professional approach to AI Safety Assurance.

---

### **If you’re a Hiring Manager / AI Security Engineer:**  
Start with:

- `model-supply-chain/intake-pipeline-overview.md`
- `model-supply-chain/sbom-generation-and-verification.md`
- `red-teaming/garak/example-garak-assessment.md`
- `red-teaming/promptfoo/example-redteam-config.yaml`

These demonstrate real hands-on security workflows, pipelines, and testing.

---

### **If you want end-to-end understanding:**  
Review:

- `docs/full-model-intake-workflow.md`
- `risk-and-governance/model-risk-classification.md`
- `red-teaming/model-safety-evaluation-framework.md`

This shows the complete lifecycle from intake → analysis → red teaming → governance.
