This section focuses on **how AI models are obtained, verified, and approved** before use.

Topics covered:

- Download locations and staging (e.g., local model folder)
- Hashing and integrity verification (SHA256)
- Static analysis using YARA and ClamAV
- Basic PyRIT-style checks and metadata review
- Building a staged intake pipeline (Stage 1 → Stage 4)

See `intake-pipeline-overview.md` for the end-to-end flow.
